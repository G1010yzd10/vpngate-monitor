# 🛡️ VPN Gate Monitor

> **Every 6 hours** this repo fetches the complete public [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/) server list, **cleans, deduplicates and archives** it — and then does the part that matters: it **opens a real OpenVPN tunnel to every single listed server**, verifies that traffic genuinely exits through it, checks *where* it exits, and measures real download throughput.
>
> **Everything below this line is the auto-generated living report. No hand-edited numbers.**

## ⚙️ How the pipeline works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["cron: every 6h"] --> F["fetch vpngate.net CSV API"]
    F --> L["log raw + meta"]
    L --> CL["clean + type-check"]
    CL --> D["dedupe hostname + IP"]
    D --> A["archive .csv.gz snapshot"]

    T --> R["report: README + badges + history"]
    R --> P["commit and push"]
```

1. **Fetch** — `GET /api/iphone/` with retries and endpoint fallback; responses are validated (the API sometimes serves an empty placeholder page to datacenter IPs) and the raw bytes are logged and hashed (sha256).
2. **Clean** — parse the special CSV (`*vpn_servers` marker, `#`-prefixed header), type-check every numeric field, validate IPs, drop broken rows, strip noise.
3. **Dedupe** — remove exact `(HostName, IP)` duplicates, then same-IP entries keeping the highest-scoring one.
4. **Archive** — every run writes an immutable gzipped snapshot to `archive/` (auto-pruned to the newest 360 ≈ 90 days).
5. **Test — the real deal.** For **every** server, every run: decode its embedded OpenVPN config, force it onto a per-worker `tun` device, disable pushed routes, pin two /32 routes through the tunnel to per-worker Cloudflare anycast IPs, wait for *Initialization Sequence Completed*, then verify egress (`cdn-cgi/trace` through the tunnel must return a foreign exit IP + real exit country) and measure a 5 MB download through the same tunnel. Up to 48 isolated tunnels run in parallel; a server that never completes the handshake is hard-killed after 25 s.
6. **Report** — this README, four live badges, `latest.json`, `summary.json` and the `history.jsonl` log are regenerated and committed by `github-actions[bot]`.

## 📁 Data files & programmatic use

All results are in this repo — hotlink them straight from `https://github.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor`:

- [`data/latest.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/main/data/latest.json) — the merged dataset: every cleaned server + its latest real test result
- [`data/servers_clean.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/main/data/servers_clean.csv) — cleaned, deduplicated server list (no bulky config blobs)
- [`data/summary.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/main/data/summary.json) — compact run summary with failure breakdown
- [`data/history.jsonl`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/main/data/history.jsonl) — one JSON line per run, append-only
- [`archive/`](https://github.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/tree/main/archive) — immutable gzipped snapshots of every run
- full logs, raw API response and per-server error details are attached to each [Actions run](https://github.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/actions) as artifacts (30-day retention)

Grab a working VPN right now:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G1010yzd10/vpngate-monitor/main/data/latest.json \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys;[print(s['IP'],s['CountryShort'],s['test']['download_mbps'],'Mbps') for s in json.load(sys.stdin) if s['test'] and s['test']['alive']]" \
  | sort -k3 -nr | head
```

Field units: `Score` points · `Ping` ms · `Speed` bit/s (self-reported) · `Uptime` ms · `TotalUsers` count · `TotalTraffic` bytes · `download_mbps` Mbps (measured through the tunnel).

## 🔬 Methodology & caveats

- **Real tunnels, not CSV checks.** A server only counts as alive if OpenVPN completed its handshake *and* an HTTPS request bound to the tunnel egressed with a foreign IP. A server whose tunnel silently black-holes traffic fails the egress step and is reported dead.
- **No DNS through the VPN.** Test destinations are pinned with `curl --resolve` to per-worker Cloudflare anycast addresses, so a broken/hijacking VPN DNS can never fake a success.
- **Throughput** is one 5 MB download to `speed.cloudflare.com` through the live tunnel — a sample, not a lab measurement.
- **Vantage point**: GitHub Actions runners (Azure, usually US/EU). A server that is slow from there may be fast from your country, and vice versa.
- **Fairness**: volunteer servers are shared — measured speeds dip when many clients are connected (`NumVpnSessions` is listed).
- **Security**: test traffic is TLS to Cloudflare only; we never send anything sensitive through volunteer servers. Neither should you — assume the operator can see traffic metadata.
